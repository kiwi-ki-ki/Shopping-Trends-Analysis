# Shopping-Trends-Analysis

## Introduction

This analysis was conducted using Tableau 2024.3 with the dataset XXXX from Kaggle. To support informed business decision-making, understanding customer behavior is critical. This project examined shopper data to explore how consumer demographics, seasonal consumer behavior, and spending habits by age and payment method intersect.

The purpose of the study was to uncover insights into who the shoppers are, when and how frequently they shop, what they purchase, and how they prefer to pay. By identifying patterns across demographics, seasonal behaviors, and spending/payment trends, the findings provide actionable guidance for enhancing customer engagement, tailoring product offerings, and optimizing marketing strategies.

## The Analysis
The analysis consisted of nine graphs and four dashboards. These visualizations were designed to highlight key findings across the three discovery areas: consumer demographics, seasonal consumer behavior, and spending habits by age and payment method.

### Visualizations
V1. Shopper Demographics – A bubble graph displaying the count of shoppers by age bracket and gender. Results showed the majority of customers were males between ages 25–44.

V2. Number of Purchases by Gender – A tree graph illustrating repeated purchases by gender, grouped into bins of 10 purchases.

V3. Item Rankings – A side-by-side bar graph showing the average rating of items ranked above 3.75, aggregated by sales contribution (50% of total sales) and number of purchasing customers.

V4. Top Items by Category and Gender – A tree graph showing the most popular products and categories by gender, revealing male customers dominated in clothing and accessory purchases.

V5. Total Sales by State – A geographical graph of the United States displaying total sales by state. Montana showed the highest sales ($5,784), while Kansas recorded the lowest ($3,437).

V6. Payment Type by Age – A small multiples bar graph comparing the top three payment methods by age group. Credit cards were most common for shoppers aged 25–34 and 55–64.

V7. Purchase Frequency by Age – A dot plot visualizing purchase frequency by age bracket and time interval. Shoppers aged 25–34 emerged as the most frequent purchasers.

V8. Best Season by State – A geographical graph indicating each state’s peak shopping season using color coding (Fall = Orange, Spring = Pink, Summer = Green, Winter = Blue).

V9. Top Items by Season – A side-by-side bar graph presenting the most purchased items by season, with seasonal color differentiation. While no single dominant trend emerged, the graph enabled comparison of seasonal purchase volumes.

### Dashboards
Dashboard 1: Purchaser Demographics – Combined V1, V4, and V7 to highlight key demographic and behavioral insights.

Dashboard 2: Seasonal Trends – Incorporated V8 and V9 for a focused view of seasonal consumer behavior.

Dashboard 3: Age Brackets – Combined V6 and V7 to connect purchasing frequency and payment methods by age group.

Dashboard 4: Key Findings – Summarized significant insights by emphasizing demographic and product category trends (V1 and V4).

## Conclusion

The analysis identified three major categories of discovery: consumer demographics, seasonal consumer behavior, and spending habits by age and payment method.

Consumer Demographics: The majority of shoppers were male, particularly between the ages of 25 and 64. Males spent nearly twice as much as females on footwear and outerwear, and also purchased dresses, skirts, and jewelry at higher rates—likely as gifts. Most shoppers made purchases monthly or quarterly.

Seasonal Consumer Behavior: Spring and fall were the strongest sales seasons across most states, while summer showed fewer peaks. In spring, shoppers purchased both warm-weather items (sandals, shorts, skirts) and cold-weather goods (coats, gloves, boots). Summer sales centered on dresses, jewelry, and shoes. Fall was dominated by layered clothing such as sweaters, jackets, and accessories like hats and handbags, while both sandals and boots remained popular. During winter, smaller accessories—including sunglasses, jewelry, and hats—were more frequently purchased, reflecting holiday gift-buying behavior.

Spending Habits by Age and Payment Method: Shoppers aged 35–44 frequently used debit cards, showing the highest volume of weekly and monthly purchases. Shoppers aged 25–34 often relied on Venmo and purchased bi-weekly. Bank transfers were most common among shoppers aged 18–24 and those over 65. Across ages 25–64, cash, credit cards, and PayPal remained the dominant payment methods.

Together, these insights reveal how demographics, seasonal preferences, and age-related payment choices influence consumer behavior. By leveraging these findings, businesses can better target their audiences, refine product assortments, and enhance marketing effectiveness.
